# Netflix Landing Page Clone (Tailwind Version)

This project is a clone of the Netflix landing page using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The original version relied on custom CSS for styling, but this updated version has been fully migrated to **Tailwind CSS** for a cleaner and more maintainable design system.

## Features

- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Leverages Tailwind's utility-first approach for rapid styling and customization.
- **Customizable Theme**: Easy-to-update Tailwind configuration for color schemes, spacing, and typography.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across modern web browsers.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (if using a build tool for Tailwind):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the Tailwind CLI to build the CSS:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./style/output.css --watch
   ```
4. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the app.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the page's content.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the layout with utility-first classes.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and animations.
